				Welcome to The Travelling guide.
				Here's my first blog.
				Since the past 6-7 days I've been thinking how to start a blog. I was trying to figure out what I love to do and it was really difficult for me to figure out. So now I've decided a topic on which I shall start blogging.
				The topic I've chosen is "The New Travelling Guide". Using this blog I'll try my best to guide travelers moving to a new place/country so that they have hassle free journey/trips to the said country.
